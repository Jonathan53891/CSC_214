/*

Write a program that takes user input describing a playing card in the 
following shorthand notation:
A -> Ace
2..10 -> Face Vaue
J->Jack
Q->Queen
K->King
D->Diamonds
H->Hearts
S->Spades
C->Clubs

Your program should print the full description of the card. For example,
Enter the card notation: QS 
Queen of Spades

Implement a class Card whose constructor takes the card notation string 
and whose getDescription method returns a description of the card. If the 
notation string is not in the correct format, the getDescription method 
should return the string "Unknown".
