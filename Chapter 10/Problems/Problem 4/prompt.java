 Suppose we have a string holding the text of an entire book. If we want to 
 analyze segments of the text, it is inefficient to make substrings. Instead, 
 we should just store a reference to the original text and the starting and 
 ending positions. Design a class Segment that does this, and have it 
 implement the CharSequence interface of the standard library.
