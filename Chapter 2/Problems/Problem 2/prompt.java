/*
Look into the API documentation of the String class and locate the trim method. 
Write a program demonstrating what it does. 
Then show how you can use the replace method to remove all spaces from a string. 
The output should look like:
This program demonstrates the behavior of String's trim() function.
The starting string is 
  Here is a string   with  multiple spaces   
And here it is after applying the trim function
Here is a string   with  multiple spaces
And after removing all spaces using the replace function:
Hereisastringwithmultiplespaces
