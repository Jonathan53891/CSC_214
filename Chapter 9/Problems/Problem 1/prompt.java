Suppose the class Employee is declared as follows: 

public class Employee 
{ 
     private String name; 
     private double baseSalary; 
     public void setName(String newName) { . . . } 
     public void setBaseSalary(double newSalary) { . . . } 
     public String getName() { . . . } 
     public double getSalary() { . . . }
} 

Declare a class Manager that inherits from the class Employee and adds an 
instance variable bonus for storing a salary bonus. 

Implement the constructors and methods, and supply a test program.
