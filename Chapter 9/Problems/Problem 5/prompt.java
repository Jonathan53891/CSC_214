Implement a superclass Appointment and subclasses Onetime, Daily, and Monthly. 

An appointment has a description (for example, “see the dentist”) and occurs 
on one or more dates. 

Write a method occursOn(int year, int month, int day) that checks whether the 
appointment occurs on that date. For example, for a monthly appointment, you 
must check whether the day of the month matches. 

Then fill an array of Appointment objects with a mixture of appointments. 
Have the user enter a date and print out all appointments that occur on that 
date. 

This requires the use of polymorphism.
