An online bank wants you to create a program that shows prospective customers 
how their deposits will grow. Your program should read the initial balance 
and the annual interest rate. Interest is compounded monthly. Print out the 
balances after the first three months. Here is a sample run: 

Initial balance: 1000 
Annual interest rate in percent: 6.0 
After first month: 1005.00 
After second month: 1010.03 
After third month: 1015.08
