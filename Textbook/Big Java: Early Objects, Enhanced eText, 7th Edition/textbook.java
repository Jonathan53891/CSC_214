/*

This course will use the following text book:

"Big Java: Early Objects, Enhanced eText, 7th Edition" by Cay Horstman

I rented the e-book off of Chegg so I could interact with the online 
module and run the various code examples in real-time, but the use of
this resource is entirely up to the student.
