Implement a class Car with the following properties. 
A car has a certain fuel efficiency (measured in miles/gallon or liters/kmâ€”pick one) 
and a certain amount of fuel in the gas tank. The efficiency is specified in the 
constructor, and the initial fuel level is 0. Supply a method drive that simulates 
driving the car for a certain distance, reducing the amount of gasoline in the fuel 
tank. Also supply methods getGasInTank, returning the current amount of gasoline in 
the fuel tank, and addGas, to add gasoline to the fuel tank. Sample usage:

Car myHybrid = new Car(50); // 50 miles per gallon 
myHybrid.addGas(20); // Tank 20 gallons 
myHybrid.drive(100); // Drive 100 miles 
double gasLeft = myHybrid.getGasInTank(); // Get gas remaining in tank 

You may assume that the drive method is never called with a distance that consumes 
more than the available gas. Supply a method in main that tests all methods.
