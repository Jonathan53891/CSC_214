/*

Simulate a tally counter that can be used to admit a limited number of people. 
First, the limit is set with a call

public void setLimit(int maximum)

If the click button is clicked more often than the limit, it has no effect. 

(Hint: The call Math.min(n, limit) returns n if n is less than limit, and limit otherwise.)

Break your solution into 2 classes.  
Main which tests the class, and Counter which is where the functionality is implemented.

The contents of Main, which is a test driver, have been given.


NOTE: TO KEEP THEM BOTH IN THE SAME FILE DO NOT USE PUBLIC IN FRONT OF THEM

That is not required in a non repl system or in the projects.  But in a single file system it is.

Expected output:
 
3
Expected: 3
3
Expected: 3
