/*

Write a program that prints the balance of an account after the first, second, and third year. 
The account has an initial balance of $1,000 and earns 5 percent interest per year.

Note. By default a calculation ending in 0 such as 1000.00 will display as 1000.0.  
Likewise, something ending in more than 2 digits like .325 wont be rounded but will display as .325

Leave these for now.  We will address how to make them prettier later.
