Implement a program that prints paychecks for a group of student assistants. 

Deduct federal and Social Security taxes. (You may want to use the tax 
computation used in Chapter 5. Find out about Social Security taxes on the 
Internet.) 

Your program should prompt for the names, hourly wages, and hours worked of 
each student.
