Declare a class ComboLock that works like the combination lock in a gym locker, 
as shown here. 

The lock is constructed with a combinationâ€”three numbers between 0 and 39. 

The reset method resets the dial so that it points to 0. 

The turnLeft and turnRight methods turn the dial by a given number of ticks to 
the left or right. 

The open method attempts to open the lock. The lock opens if the user first 
turned it right to the first number in the combination, then left to the second, 
and then right to the third.

Implement the class as well as a test class



public class ComboLock
{
  . . .
  public ComboLock(int secret1, int secret2, int secret3) { . . . }
  public void reset() { . . . }
  public void turnLeft(int ticks) { . . . }
  public void turnRight(int ticks) { . . . }
  public boolean open() { . . . }
}
